###### MonoGame Client ######

Rampastring's next-generation client that replaces the old unmaintainable Windows Forms-based client with something far superior.


It relies on MonoGame or XNA Framework, depending on operating system. For Windows Vista and newer a build of MonoGame that supports .NET Framework 4.0 should be used, because 4.5 isn't widespread enough yet.


Windows XP is supported through Microsoft's XNA Framework, version 4.0 Refresh: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27598
