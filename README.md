The "main" client (DTA.exe / TI_Launcher.exe / TiberianSun.exe / CnCNetYRLauncher.exe) of Rampastring's CnCNet Client.

Get the code, open the solution in Visual Studio 2013 / 2015 and compile it.

When making modifications, make sure that your code doesn't cause issues in any of the 4 supported games. Typically, try to make your code so that it works and is useful for all supported games; or if you're making code for a specific game only, make sure that it doesn't break the other games and document the code accordingly.

If you have questions, ask Rampastring.
