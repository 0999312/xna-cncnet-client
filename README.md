# CnCNet Client #
=================

The MonoGame / XNA CnCNet client, a platform for setting up and launching both singleplayer and multiplayer games with a CnCNet game spawner. Includes setting configuration, handling compatibility issues, and extras like map editor (FinalSun) configuration and match statistics. The primary targets of the project are Dawn of the Tiberium Age, Twisted Insurrection, Mental Omega and CnCNet Yuri's Revenge.

Requirements
------------

The client relies on either MonoGame or Microsoft's XNA Framework, depending on the build platform. The repository includes MonoGame and other necessary references for building for the MonoGame Windows (Vista and newer) platform. For compiling the XNA build, Microsoft XNA Game Studio 4.0 Refresh is needed.


For end-users running Vista or newer Windows, the MonoGame build is preferred. The MonoGame build cannot be run on Windows XP, so the XNA build is intended for XP users.


Building the solution requires Visual Studio 2015.
