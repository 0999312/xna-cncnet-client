Rampastring's next-generation client that replaces the old unmaintainable Windows Forms-based client with something far superior.


It relies on MonoGame. A build of MonoGame that supports .NET Framework 4.0 should be used, because 4.5 isn't widespread enough yet.


Windows XP is currently unsupported. Support should be added before public release (will need a different MonoGame.Framework.dll).


Prerequisites:
MonoGame.Framework: http://www.monogame.net/
I think I used some development build of MonoGame 3.5.

DTAUpdater.dll: http://dta.cnc-comm.com/dev/Resources/Binaries/DTAUpdater.dll


DTAConfig.dll and DTAUpdater.dll are currently based on old code and will be replaced with newer, likely open-source versions later on.
