; Renderer sections start below.

; The main ddraw.dll for a renderer is specified in DLLName=. 
; The file is expected to be found from the Resources\ directory, and it is
; copied to the game directory as ddraw.dll when settings are saved.

; AdditionalFiles= is a comma-separated list of additional files to be copied
; to the game directory. The client also expects to find them from the Resources\
; directory, and copies them to the main directory when settings are saved. 

; ConfigFilePath= works similarly. The only difference is that if the config
; file already exists, it is not overwritten (the DLLs and additional files are).

; You can also specify sub-directories in the Resources\ directory for the paths.
; For example, if you specify DLLPath=Renderers\my_awesome_wrapper.dll, the client
; expects to find the file from \Resources\Renderers\my_awesome_wrapper.dll.
; When settings are saved, it is still copied to the root of the main game directory.
